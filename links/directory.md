So I feel it could be super useful
one as an online thing, and two as a place for teens in this area
High Speed wifi, a little healthy food, access to a large growing business nearby (hopefully)
would help motivate some people in the area
could start some sort of stream event where kids who always wanted to be streamers can have their chance at it on Saturdays at our shop or something
kids signup, we use our official stream account for them
the rest of the week we have official streamers doing what they do best
helps give the kids a way to do that since it's almost impossible with most of the wifi's around here
but we'd have top notch top paid everything wifi.
"Everyone deserves a chance" streams
idk
have a library of games for them to play
work with game business's to sell games at cheaper than usual
humble bundle partnership
merch store
Make a line of meme and stupid fact gear
